This project is primarily distributed through a maven repository at:

http://dhager.github.com/mvn-repo/releases/

In order to use the library, the HLLib DLLs must be independently downloaded and placed into your project.

Copies are available from the [jhllib github page](https://github.com/DHager/jhllib), although downloading from the [HLLib site](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=35) is also possible.

Any DLLs downloaded from the HLLib site will need to be a compatible version and will need to be renamed.
