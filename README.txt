---Licensing:

JHllib is licensed under the LGPL, and is distributed with binaries (DLL files)
that come from from HLLib, a separately maintained project under the same license.

For more information on HLLib (which honestly does most of the work anyway), see:
http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=35



---Logging:

This project uses SLF4J to handle logging. Please consult the SLF4J site to
determine which adapter library you require in order to plug-in you desired
logging implementation.

Once the SLF4J logging dependencies are satisfied and on the
classpath, you would see something like:

    Attempting to load HlLib...
    Retrieving version...
    Version detected as '2.1.1'
